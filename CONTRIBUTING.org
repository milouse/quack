grab them from the source code tree and send your changes as a pull request.

* Code

The canonical repository is located at
[[https://git.umaneti.net/quack]]. Mirror exists on [[https://framagit.org/milouse/quack][Framagit]] and on [[https://github.com/milouse/quack][Github]].

Merge request and issues are accepted on all mirrors.

Please note that for historical reason, those repository are only named "quack",
even if the resulting gem is "quack_aur". Long time ago, quack was a python
script, and I discovered only after rewriting it to ruby that another unrelated
gem was already named quack, and thus was obliged to change the name.
